// Java Packages:
// A package contains one or more related classes

// The below line of code imports all the classes in the awt package
import java.awt.*;
// The below line of code imports all the classes in the awt.color package
import java.awt.color.*;
// The import process is not recursive

// When would you want to have a non-public class?
// When you don't want to share the class with other class for implementation reasons
