Anatomy of a Java program
-------------------------

- The smallest bulding block of a Java program is the function. A function is a chunk of code that performs a specific task.

	- I.e. Sending emails, unit conversion, etc...

- Example function in Java:
	
void main() { // The void keyword means the program does not return anything
	// Every Java program should have this main keyword
	...
}

- Classes are things that store functions, each class contains related functions
- A function in a class is called a method

- Example:

public class Main { // the public keyword means that the class can be accessed normally
	// All classes are capitalized
	public void main() { // Methods are lower case
		...
	}
}
