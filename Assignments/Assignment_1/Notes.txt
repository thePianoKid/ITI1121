There have been a number of queries as to what you are allowed and not allowed to do when doing an assignment. For your convenience, I have summarized below all the guidelines (including the ones already explicitly noted in the assignment description). The same guidelines apply to future assignments, unless stated otherwise.

What you are allowed to do:
You can alter the private methods as you wish. The templates provided for the private methods is meant at assisting you rather than to place constraints on your implementation.
You can remove any given private methods and define your own private methods. This can go even as far as not having any private methods at all.
You can define additional private variables if you find this absolutely necessary.
The Java compiler imports the java.lang package by default. You can use any of the classes / methods in java.lang. 

What you are not allowed to do:
You cannot define new classes.
You cannot change the signature of any of the public methods.
You cannot add any new public methods.
You cannot add any new public variables.
You cannot import any classes or packages beyond the ones already imported in the starter code.
You cannot modify the public methods that are already marked as complete int the provided starter code.
You cannot structure your code into packages. All classes shall remain in the default package (i.e., there must be no package declaration in your Java classes).
[EDITED Jan 17th to state that introducing packages is not allowed.]
[EDITED Jan 17th to state that using the classes and methods in the default import (java.lang) is allowed.]
